Partition

1) Partition
2) Format partition with a file system

3) Mounting: attach a directory to the partition
Mounting 2 types: temporary and permanent
for temparary use mount command
for permanent we need to change configuration file like fs-tab
/etc/fstab

4) Inform the Kernal to use the partition
commands - partprobe or mount -a (refresh/restart)

$ fdisk -l
$ lsblk
$ blkid


6 parameters- for swapping permanent in the fstab file
uuid
mount point by the name of 'swap'
file system by the name 'swap'
defaults
5-0 backup any time 
6-0 start all services at boot

6 parameters for persistent mounting in fstab
uuid
mounting directory name
file system name eg - ext2
defaults
0
0

before deleting any disks we need to remove every thing related to that disk written in the fstab file


swap is present in secondary storage as it is twice the memory of ram
swap space contains entire replica of ram that helps in recovery, keeps backup of ram
swap space is twice size of ram used for replica
game is 50gb and ram is 8gb, but until the game is loaded in ram we cannot enter, here main memory/secondary is divided into so many pages and pages are loaded by frames in primary/ram so by swap in and swap out we can load the game


Persistent mounting /permanent Mounting
create a partition 
mkdir mount_dir
mount -a
cd /etc/
nano fstab
blkid for uuid
UUID=af4eb3ea-6aff-4a68-8f00-5c70f0b846e5 /home/yaswanth/mount_dir ext2 defaults 0 0
save and exit file
mount -a
systemctl daemon-reload
lsblk


Mounting - temporary
create a partition 
mkdir mount_dir
mount -a
mkfs.ext2 /dev/nvme0n3p1
mount /dev/nvme0n3p1 /home/yaswanth/mount_dir
mount -a
systemctl daemon-reload
lsblk


for swap partition we use mkswap /dev/nvme0n3p1
we get the uuid and use remaing steps for mounting
