After CA-1
#create 2 users v1,v2
$useradd v1
$useradd v2

#create passwords for users
$passwd v1
$passwd v2

#create liux group
$groupadd linux

#Add both users to linux group
//-aG -> append to group
$usermod -aG linux v1
$usermod -aG linux v2

#from root create a common folder
$mkdir /common
$ls -ld /common  //to check the permisions of file (usergroupothers)

#change the group from root to linux for common folder
$chgrp linux /common
$ls -ld /common  

#give write permissions to linux grp in common folder 
$chmod g+w /common or
$chmod 777 /common
$ls -ld /common  

#As /common is under root directory which is top-level we need to give permissions to root folder also
$chmod 777 /root
$ls -ld /root  

now we can go into any user and create files which can access by other users also in group

##Stiky-bit from root
Since any user can delete the content written by other users here comes stiky-bit by which only the owner can delete or update the file others can just see the data
$chmod 1777 /common





























disk partitioning
#in root
$fdisk -l
$useradd new
$passwd new

#go to new user
$su -new
$fdisk -l   //-> gives error
exit

$cd /usr/sbin/
$ls fdisk -l
$chmod u+s fdisk

now when we go to any user we can check fdisk -l without any errors
